## Home Page

A thoroughly animated and simple homepage that grabs the users attention straight away, with a slideshow enabled header, loading different images at a declared interval. In regards to the navigation bar the use of FontAwesome will be used to apply stylish icons. Keyframes will be used throughout the website to animate features.
