To improve on the previous designs an asthetically pleasing landing page was designed, this lead to the change of having a website with multiple html documents to a SPA, whereby all sections of the website will be based in a index file. The inclusion of social media links will also be added, along with ability to change website theme. Upon entering the website it will locate to home, these different sections will implement the use of jQuery hide and show fuctionality.

Second design for homepage has minimal change. However, the addition of staff images will be visible. When clicked modal boxes should appear with information regarding the staff member. In the footer a button will be placed to allow the user to return back to the top of the webpage, again this will use jQuery smooth scrolling feature to enable this.
